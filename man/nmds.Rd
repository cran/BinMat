\title{Creates a non-metric multidimensional scaling plot (nMDS).}
\usage{
nmds(
  x,
  dist_meth = "binary",
  k_val = 2,
  pt_size = 1,
  colours,
  shapes,
  labs = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Consolidated binary matrix with grouping information in the second column.}

\item{dist_meth}{Distance method. Set to "binary" by default. Other options are "euclidean", "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", or "minkowski".}

\item{k_val}{Number of dimensions for the nMDS plot. Set to 2 by default.}

\item{pt_size}{Point size for symbols on the plot. Set to 1 by default.}

\item{colours}{Vector containing colours to be assigned to groups.}

\item{shapes}{Vector containing pch values for shapes to be used for points.}

\item{labs}{Indicate whether labels should appear on the graph or not (TRUE or FALSE). Default = FALSE.}
}
\value{
nMDS plot.
}
\description{
Creates an non-metric multidimensional scaling plot from a consolidated binary matrix with grouping information. Colours and shapes of plotted points need to be specified. For example, if there are two groups, then: clrs = c("red", "blue"), sh = c(16, 16). This assigns red to the first group name, and blue to the second. Both will have a pch shape of 16 (round dot). These two vectors are then passed to the function nmds() as: colours = clrs, shapes = sh.
}
\examples{
 mat = BinMatInput_ordination
group.names(mat)
clrs = c("red", "green", "black")
shp = c(16,16,16)
nmds(mat, colours = clrs, shapes = shp, labs = TRUE)

}
